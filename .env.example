# DSCI 510 Final Project - Sangwoo Choi
# This project does not require any API keys.

# If you wanted to override settings from src/config.py using
# environment variables, you could define them here, e.g.:
#
# RESULTS_DIR=results
# START_DATE=2010-01-01
#
# For normal use and grading, you do not need to set anything here.
