#DSCI 510 Final Project – Building a Set and Forget ETF Strategy for Graduate Students

This project explores how young investors can use data to evaluate long-term ETF investment strategies using Python. It is part of DSCI 510: Principles of Programming for Data Science.

Note: This repository currently contains preliminary setup for the progress report stage. Full analysis code and results will be added in the final submission.

Project Summary
The goal is to compare different ETF investment strategies—growth, dividend, and blended portfolios—and show how consistent investing (Dollar Cost Averaging vs Lump Sum) performs over 20–30 years. APIs and data sources include Yahoo Finance (yfinance) and optional FRED for inflation and interest rates.

Planned Features
- Load and clean historical ETF data using Python
- Calculate CAGR, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown
- Simulate Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) vs Lump Sum investing
- Visualize growth over time, risk/return scatter plots, and correlation matrices

Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- yfinance (API)
- requests (for FRED API)

Current Progress
Repository created
Requirements listed
Progress report submitted
Data collection and analysis scripts under development
Basic API test (yfinance) implemented and verified for SPY data retrieval.


Next Steps
1. Implement ETF data fetching and cleaning
2. Add risk/return metric calculations
3. Generate first visualizations (growth and volatility comparison)
